# 2017-Interactive-Systems-UWA-Arduino-Exercises

Included here is a sample of weekly exercises that thirds-year UWA Design students received in IDES3010 (Advanced Design Thinking). These exercises were designed to give them a basic technical proficiency, so they can build more advanced final projects. 

These materials are for educational purposes and were composed by combining numerous open-source resources. Reuse however you see fit.
